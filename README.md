About Me: 
My name is Samhitha (she/her), and I am a junior at Rutgers University, pursuing a dual major in Data Science and Computer Science. 

Currently, as an AI Studio Intern at JPMorganChase and an AI/ML Fellow at Cornell Tech, I am immersed in real-world financial applications of machine learning and modeling, building my technical skills and collaborating with a diverse team.

In past experiences, I've surrounded myself with the powerful tool that is data. At Fidelis Pharmaceuticals and WINLAB, I've worked on real-world projects where I collaborated with diverse teams to deliver impactful solutions. These roles allowed me to apply data analysis and visualization techniques, helping transform complex problems into actionable insights.

In addition to my technical work, I've embraced leadership roles as the President of the Rutgers Undergraduate Student Alliance of Computer Scientists, where I organize events, mentor students, and foster a supportive community. These experiences have taught me the importance of collaboration, communication, and creating opportunities for others to succeed.

I am passionate about working with teams to drive meaningful outcomes that better others' experiences. I look forward to continuing to learn and grow in environments that encourage innovation and leadership, and am ready for a challenge from which I can grow.
